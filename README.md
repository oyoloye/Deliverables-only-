# Deliverables-only-
This repository is for the required deliverables for the SLICC application.

According to the Center for American Progress, about 43 million adult Americans—roughly
one-sixth of the U.S. population older than age 18—currently carry a federal student loan and
owe $1.5 trillion in federal student loan debt, plus an estimated $119 billion in student loans
from private sources that are not backed by the government. Postgraduate many students have
a difficult time repaying loans back due to a lack of transparency as well as student loan
repayment plan. As a current college student, I aim to solve this problem. For my individual
project, I have decided to create a website that allows a borrower to enter in their loan details to
construct a repayment plan. Not only do many owe tens of thousands, but finding a job that
supplements repayment can be quite challenging. This tool is needed as it would allow student
loans to be repaid in a more efficient manner and decrease the student loan crisis.
